# Import & Modules
By the end of the project I should be able to explain
 
    Why Python programming is awesome
    How to import functions from another file
    How to use imported functions
    How to create a module
    How to use the built-in function dir()
    How to prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
    How to use command line arguments with your Python programs

## Technologies
- shell scripts written in Bash 
- Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
- C are files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
