# Data Structures: List & Tuples
By the end of the project  I should be able to :

    Why Python programming is awesome
    What are lists and how to use them
    What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
    What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
    How to use lists as stacks and queues
    What are list comprehensions and how to use them
    What are tuples and how to use them
    When to use tuples versus lists
    What is a sequence
    What is tuple packing
    What is sequence unpacking
    What is the `del` statement and how to use it

## Technology 
- Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
- C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
