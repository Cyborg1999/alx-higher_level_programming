# Everything is object

By the end of this sections I will be able to explain:

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What is an object
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
* What is a reference
* What is an assignment
* What is an alias
* How to know if two variables are identical
* How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
* How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
* What is mutable and immutable
* What are the built-in mutable types
* What are the built-in immutable types
* How does Python pass variables to functions

## Technologies

* Python Scripts are written with Python 3.4.3
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

All `.txt` files store the answers to the questions asked by the ALX tasks.

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `19-copy_list.py` | Function that returns a copy of a list |
| `100-magic_string.py` | Function that returns a string "Holberton" n times the number of the iteration |
| `101-locked_class.py` | Class `LockedClass` with no class or object attribute, that prevents the user from dynamically creating new instance attributes, except if the new instance is called `first_name` |
